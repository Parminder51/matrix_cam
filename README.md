This is another simple script of mine that well while not being practical, is just really cool. Check it out and you'll totally understand what it is. And no, it doesn't just do what the pic above is showing.

### **You do need a webcam for this(obviously)!**
## Requirements

The packages used in it are-
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pygame

If you want to run the python script just use the code below for installing the packages:
```
pip install opencv-python
pip install pygame
```

Or else you can also use the zip file which contains a .exe executable file, the link for which is down below.
